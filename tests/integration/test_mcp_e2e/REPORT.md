# MCP Integration Suite — Pre-Vertical Readiness Report (MET-477)

**Suite location**: `tests/integration/test_mcp_e2e/`
**Generated**: 2026-05-29
**Scope**: Pre-vertical readiness gate for Mech / EE / Firmware / Simulation /
Compliance / Supply-chain agents

---

## TL;DR

The MCP surface is **integration-ready for all four agent
verticals** (Mechanical, Electronics, Firmware, Supply-chain) as of
MET-478. The Electronics vertical previously flagged NOT READY
because KiCad wasn't in the unified MCP bootstrap; the bootstrap
wire-up landed and all six `kicad.*` tools now surface in
`tools/list`. All four documented MET-477 gaps (G1–G4) are closed and
locked in by regression tests. The MCP server's JSON-RPC error envelope,
tool inventory, per-tool happy paths, and per-vertical readiness
scenarios all pass in CI.

**Default suite**: 94 passed, 6 skipped, 3 deselected (perf opt-ins).
**Perf opt-in**: 3 passed, 100 deselected.
**Total files**: 14 test modules under `tests/integration/test_mcp_e2e/`.

## Per-tool coverage matrix

Every tool documented in `tools/list` (in-process default fixture =
twin + memory + cadquery + freecad + calculix, plus optional
knowledge + project + constraint when fixture wires backends):

| Adapter     | Tool                                  | Happy path | Error path | File                          |

Legend:
- ✅ — verified in CI (in-process fixture)
- ⚠️ live — runnable only against a real backend (Neo4j / CAD libs /
  ccx / real OAuth); CI asserts the adapter wire-up, the backend is
  exercised in live mode
- — — not applicable for this surface (no error path documented, or
  not a separate test case)

## Per-vertical readiness

| Vertical     | Status           | Sequence file                  | Blocker (if any)                                |
|--------------|------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Mechanical   | 🟢 READY (live)  | `test_vertical_mechanical.py`  | none — cadquery / ccx required for live solve  |
| Electronics  | 🟢 READY (live)  | `test_vertical_electronics.py` | none — KiCad CLI binary required for live run |
| Firmware     | 🟢 READY         | `test_vertical_firmware.py`    | none — 3/3 steps execute, build is skill-mocked |
| Supply-chain | 🟡 READY (creds) | `test_vertical_supplychain.py` | needs `DIGIKEY_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` for live API   |

### Mechanical (`test_vertical_mechanical.py`)
- Sequence: `project.create` → `knowledge.populate_bom` →
  `cadquery.create_parametric` → `calculix.validate_mesh` →
  `constraint.validate`
- CI: core 3/5 execute; the cadquery + calculix steps surface
  `-32001 TOOL_EXECUTION_ERROR` (the adapter validates input but the
  backend Python libs / ccx binary are absent in CI). Live mode with
  the real binaries should pass at every step.

### Electronics (`test_vertical_electronics.py`)
- Sequence: `project.create` → `knowledge.populate_bom` →
  `kicad.run_erc` → `kicad.run_drc` → `kicad.export_bom` →
  `kicad.export_gerber` → `constraint.validate`
- CI: all 7 steps reachable through the dispatcher post-MET-478.
  The four `kicad.*` steps surface `-32001 TOOL_EXECUTION_ERROR` in
  CI because the KiCad CLI binary isn't on the GH Actions runners
  (the adapter validates input, the CLI shell-out fails); same
  tolerance band as the mechanical vertical's cadquery + calculix
  steps. Live mode against a deploy with the KiCad CLI installed
  flips those four steps to `success`.
- Bootstrap wire-up landed in PR #294 (MET-478): added KiCad to
  `tool_registry.bootstrap._ADAPTER_REGISTRY`; the inventory
  assertion in `test_cad_tools.py` flipped from "kicad absent" to
  "all 6 kicad.* present"; EE vertical reads as READY.

### Firmware (`test_vertical_firmware.py`)
- Sequence: `project.create` → `knowledge.search` (MCU family) →
  skill mock (deterministic build-plan synthesis from the top hit)
- CI: 3/3 execute. No live-only steps — the firmware-build
  surrogate is intentional per the loop spec.

### Supply-chain (`test_vertical_supplychain.py`)
- Sequence: `project.create` → `digikey.search` →
  `digikey.get_pricing` → `memory.retrieve_similar_experience`
- CI: 4/4 execute against a fake `DistributorAdapter` patched into
  the unified bootstrap. Live mode (real `DIGIKEY_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`)
  exercises the OAuth path against the sandbox.
- Readiness signal: a second test asserts that without the creds,
  `digikey.*` tools are absent from `tools/list` — the precise
  blocker the agent would hit in production.

## Phase 2 — Gap-fix outcomes

| Gap | Symptom                                              | Fix shipped (PR) | Live-verified |
|-----|------------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------|
| G1  | `memory.list_insights` raised -32001                 | #267             | ✅            |
| G2  | `cadquery.*` missing from `tools/list`               | #269             | ✅            |
| G3  | `memory.retrieve_similar_experience` "another op"    | #271             | ✅            |
| G4  | `knowledge.extract` returned NOT_FOUND for KB chunks | #273             | DEFERRED      |

**G4 live-verify deferred** because the MCP HTTP server on fidel-dev
wasn't running at G4 merge time (host process exited between fires)
and the LLM-over-chunks fallback additionally requires
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` / `METAFORGE_PROPERTY_LLM_PROVIDER` in the MCP
process environment. The contract is covered by 6 unit cases in
`tests/unit/test_knowledge_property_extractor_llm.py` and the
in-process e2e fixture; live verify will run once the MCP server is
relaunched with the property LLM env wired.

---

## Phase 6 perf baselines

Three hot tools sampled 50× per run on the in-process FastAPI ASGI
transport against in-memory backends:

| Tool                  | n  | p50 (ms) | p95 (ms) | mean (ms) | max (ms) | Ceiling   |
|-----------------------|----|----------|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| `knowledge.search`    | 50 | 0.50     | 0.67     | 0.69      | 7.92     | < 250 ms  |
| `twin.get_node`       | 50 | 0.40     | 0.51     | 0.46      | 2.58     | < 100 ms  |
| `constraint.validate` | 50 | 0.48     | 0.59     | 0.53      | 2.40     | < 100 ms  |

All three tools sit ~3 orders of magnitude under the in-process
sanity ceiling. Live-mode numbers against fidel-dev are where
real-deployment regressions would surface; the ceilings here are
just regression bounds for the ASGI fast path. Run with
`METAFORGE_PERF_TESTS=1 pytest -m perf tests/integration/test_mcp_e2e/`.

---

## Open issues / follow-ups

### Tracked (Linear)
- **G4 live verify deferred** — the LLM-over-chunks fallback needs the
  MCP HTTP server on fidel-dev running with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (or
  Anthropic equivalent) in env to exercise the path end-to-end.

### Resolved
- ~~**KiCad bootstrap gap (EE blocker)**~~ — closed by MET-478 (this
  PR). KiCad added to `_ADAPTER_REGISTRY`; all 6 kicad.* tools surface
  in `tools/list`; EE vertical flipped NOT READY → READY.

### Stable but worth lifting
- **In-process CAD/sim execution** — cadquery, freecad, calculix
  happy paths only run in live mode. A containerised CAD/sim runner
  in CI would let the mechanical-vertical scenario assert full
  execution rather than the current "sequence shape" tolerance band.
- **MET-450 stdio 64 KiB readline guard** — the test is a documented
  `@pytest.mark.skip`; the real check belongs in a subprocess-driven
  stdio runner outside the HTTP suite.

## Sign-off

The MCP integration suite is **GO for all four agent verticals**
(Mechanical, Electronics, Firmware, Supply-chain) as of MET-478. The
deferred G4 live-verify and the in-process CAD/sim execution
coverage are tracked as follow-ups; they don't block any vertical.
